# Remove Duplicate DOM Element directive

This repository holds the source code on which my tutorial oost SEO: [Remove duplicate DOM content with Angular's structural directives](https://pmcoding.co.uk/post/angular_structural_directives_remove_duplicate_content_for_seo_success) is based. 

To run, simply CD into the folder `remove-duplicate-dom-element-directive` and run `ng serve`. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) and resize the window to see the appropriate element disappearing. Inspect the DOM to see what the element is not only hidden, but completely removed.
